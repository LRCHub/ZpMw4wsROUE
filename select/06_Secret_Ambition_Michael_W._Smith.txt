Young man, up on the hillside
Teaching new ways
Each word, winning them over
Each heart, a kindled flame

Old men, watch from the outside
Guarding their prey
Threatened by the voice of a paragon
Leading their lambs away
Leading them far away

Nobody knew His secret ambition
Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition
He tore the holy veil away
Questioning those in powerful positions
Running to those who called His name
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

His rage, shaking the temple
His word to the wise
His hand, healing on the seventh day
His love wearing no disguise

Some say, "Death to the radical!
He's way out of line"
Some say, "Praised be the miracle!
God sends a blessed sign
A blessed sign for troubled times"

Nobody knew His secret ambition
Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition (tore away)
He tore the holy veil away (way)
Questioning those in powerful positions
Running to those who called His name (nobody knew)
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

Oooh
Ooh-oh
Oooh
Aw!

Nobody knew His secret ambition
Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition (tore away)
He tore the holy veil away (way)
Questioning those in powerful positions
Running to those who called His name (nobody knew)
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

Oooh, oooh (ooh, ooh)
No, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no!
No, no!
I tell you nobody knew
Until He gave His life away
No!

(Oooh, oooh)
(Oooh, oooh)
(Oooh, oooh)
(Oooh, oooh)
(Oooh, oooh)
